function BreakClusters(aCells, aBlobs, aT, aImData)
% Breaks cell clusters in one frame using k-means clustering.
%
% BreakClusters breaks the blobs of cell clusters into fragments so that
% each cell gets its own blob. The clusters are broken using k-means
% clustering of the coordinates of the pixels/voxels, with random seeding.
% The resulting fragments are assigned to the cells in the clusters so that
% the sum of the squared distances to the cell positions in the following
% frame is minimized. The function is meant to be used in BipartiteMatch to
% generate accurate cell tracks after track linking with
% ViterbiTrackLinking.
%
% Inputs:
% aCells  - Cells for which the blobs should be updated. It is important
%           that either all or none of the cells in a blob are included, so
%           that the blobs are broken into the correct number of fragments.
% aBlobs  - Array with the Blob objects generated by the segmentation
%           algorithm, for the time point of interest.
% aT      - The time point of interest, for which the blobs will be
%           updated.
% aImData - ImageData object for the image sequence.

% in separate blobs in the subsequent image.
