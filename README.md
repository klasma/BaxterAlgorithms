The Baxter Algorithms is a software package for tracking and analysis of cells in microscope images. The software can handle images produced using both 2D transmission microscopy and 2D or 3D fluorescence microscopy. The software has shown outstanding performance compared to other software in the ISBI Cell Tracking Challenges of 2013, 2014, 2015, 2019 and 2020. In addition to cell tracking, the Baxter Algorithms can perform automated analysis of myoblast fusion and automated analysis of fluorescent histological sections of muscle tissue. The software is written in MATLAB, but it also contains some algorithms written in C++, which are compiled into mex-files.

The software is started by running the file BaxterAlgorithms.m in 
MATLAB. For users without a MATLAB license, it is also possible to download deployed versions for 64-bit Windows and 64-bit Mac by pressing the release tab and expanding the assets dropdown under the latest release. Further instructions on how to use the software can be found in UserGuide.pdf, which is located in the folder UserGuide. There are also video tutorials in the YouTube playlist https://tinyurl.com/ba-tutorials.
